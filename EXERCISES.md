# Scrum Poker

Scrum Poker is a well-known method for estimating how much work a given ticket is expected to take by giving it a story point value, which in turn allows a team to decide which tickets fit into their story point quota (or sprint velocity) for a given time period.
For example if a team has a 10 story point quota for a sprint, this could be 10 tickets worth 1 story point each or two tickets worth 5 story points each.

These exercises task you to create a simple Scrum Poker simulator, where you will give a team of developers a series of tickets needing to be estimated.
A project template is provided to you and should be used as a guideline, make changes as you see fit. This template contains some (but not all) of the classes you may want to use, but will need to be filled out for use. The src folder contains the Java classes, the other folders contain configuration for common IDEs (Eclipse/IntelliJ) and build automation tools (maven/gradle) should you wish to use any of those. Use of libraries is allowed.

These exercises are expected to take about 1 hour, excluding any additional project setup e.g. dependency management. Please take as much time as you need.

### 1. Initialise the objects used in the simulation:

- ### 4 Developers, each with a unique name
- ### A PokerDeck of 7 PokerDeckCards, with the values of the PokerDeckCards following the Fibonacci sequence starting with the third value in the sequence

(Hint: The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0,1,1,2,3,5..., and the values should be generated programmatically)

---

### 2. A ticket has a name, owner, type (bug, feature or task) and a priority (minor, major or critical). Additionally, bug and feature tickets require a `deadline` property (a DateTime object). Create a method that accepts a ticket. All developers, excluding the ticket owner, should then vote to estimate the ticket until either...

- ### a) All cards have the same story point value
- ### b) there have been 4 rounds of voting

### Your method should return the ticket with the story point value which is closest to the average vote on the final round of voting.

(Hint: developers should pick a random card from the deck per vote)

---

### 3. Call the previous method for 10 different tickets (at least 3 tickets of each type) to generate a results report for the scrum poker session. The report should be output to a file. Please format this output using JSON.
